# MiscFunsForR
An R library with useful functions I have collected over time for plotting stock assessment stuff
There is also a few functions for interrogating CASAL models.

You can install it via 
```r
devtools::install_github("Craig44/stockassessmenthelper")
```

Once the library is installed you can query the functionality `library(help="stockassessmenthelper")` also see the vignette with the command `browseVignettes("stockassessmenthelper")`
