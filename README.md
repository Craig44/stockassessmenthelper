An R library with useful functions I have collected over time for plotting stock assessment and statistical stuff.
There is also a few functions for interrogating CASAL stock assessment models. To view the Vignette online for example plots and functionality [click here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Craig44/stockassessmenthelper/blob/master/vignettes/ExampleUseage.html)
